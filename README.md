# Chai HTTP

> HTTP integration testing with Chai assertions.

#### Features

- integration test request composition
- test http apps or external services
- assertions for common http tasks
- chai `expect` and `should` interfaces

#### Installation

This is a addon plugin for the [Chai Assertion Library](http://chaijs.com). Install via [npm](http://npmjs.org).

    npm install chai-http

#### Plugin

Use this plugin as you would all other Chai plugins.

```js
var chai = require('chai')
  , chaiHttp = require('chai-http');

chai.use(chaiHttp);
```


## Integration Testing

Chai HTTP provides and interface for live integration
testing via [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent).
To do this, you must first
construct a request to an application or url.

Upon construction you are provided a chainable api that
allow to you specify the http VERB request (get, post, etc)
that you wish to invoke.

#### Application / Server

You may use a function (such as an express or connect app)
or a node.js http(s) server as the foundation for your request.
If the server is not running, chai-http will find a suitable
port to listen on for tha given test.

```js
chai.request(app)
  .get('/')
```

#### URL

You may also use a base url as the foundation of your request.

```js
chai.request('http://localhost:8080')
  .get('/')
```

### .req (cb)

* **@param** _{Function}_ callback 
* *@cb* {Request} object
* *@cb* {Function} next (optional)
* *@returns* {this} for chaining

You may optionally use `.req` chainable to hook
into the the request preperation invocation. Use
this to modify the request object to include post
or querystring parameters, attach a file for
upload, or any other operation that superagent
provides.

```js
chai.request(app)
  .get('/')
  .req(function (req) {
    req.set('x-api-key', 'abc123');
  })
```


### .res (cb)

* **@param** _{Function}_ callback 
* *@cb* {Response}

Invoke the request to to the server. The response
will be passed as a paramter to this function so
that further testing may be done. Use the `chai-http`
assertions for testing.

```js
chai.request(app)
  .get('/')
  .res(function (res) {
    expect(res).to.have.status(200);
  });
```


## Assertions

The Chai HTTP module provides a number of assertions
for the `expect` and `should` interfaces.

### .status (code)

* **@param** _{Number}_ status number

Assert that a response has a supplied status.

```js
expect(res).to.have.status(200);
```


### .header (key[, value])

* **@param** _{String}_ header key
* **@param** _{String}_ header value (optional)

Assert that an object has a header. If a value is
provided, equality to value will be asserted.

```js
expect(req).to.have.header('x-api-key');
expect(req).to.have.header('content-type', 'text/plain');
```


### .headers


Assert that an object has headers.

```js
expect(req).to.have.headers;
```


### .ip


Assert that a string represents valid ip address.

```js
expect('127.0.0.1').to.be.an.ip;
expect('2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334').to.be.an.ip;
```


### .json / .text / .html


Assert that a `Response` or `Request` object has a given content-type.

```js
expect(req).to.be.json;
expect(req).to.be.html;
expect(req).to.be.text;
```
